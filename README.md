# NeuPixl

## About
This photo gallery app allows a user to signup, login, upload images, comment and delete images. I built this project to further my knowledge of full stack web development using the MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node.js (MERN) stack, including GraphQL and Apollo server for backend management. Additionally, this project help me further understand APIs and cloud storage, as I used Cloudinary's API for uploading and storing images. Making this app was very challenging as it combined multiple technologies some of which I have never worked with.

## Install

It is deployed courtesy of Heroku -----> [HERE](https://neupixl-b3196fa7bb12.herokuapp.com/)
## Usage

To use, simply signup and upload an image. After an upload, you can view other images, comment on them, and even delete your own images and comments.
